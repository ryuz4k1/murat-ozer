I'm Murat Özer. I graduated from Doğuş University <mark>Computer Engineering</mark>. In fact, after two years of studying at the school I gained as an industrial engineer, I switched to computer engineering. I think it's one of the <mark>best decisions</mark> I've ever made.
I'm an <mark>open source</mark> person. I share a project that I have developed personally for commercial purposes. In many conversation groups I focus on <mark>solving</mark> their problems by <mark>communicating</mark> with people. Because I am doing a project by making use of the internet and the experiences of people by adding something of course. When this happens, I share what I receive from people by adding my superior labor to people and people in need again.
I have experience in many areas. I have done more software-oriented jobs and I intend to continue my life as a software developer.
I love <mark>helping</mark>  people, adding things to them and <mark>learning</mark> from them. There is nothing <mark>team</mark> cannot overcome if we can work with this thought in developing a project..
I'm also developing myself by catching the opportunities to be given in the job and to make their lives easier by creating technologies that can be useful to people by specializing.
