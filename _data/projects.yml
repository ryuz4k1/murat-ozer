  github: ryuz4k1/twitter-sentiment-analysis
  description: |
    The purpose of this project is to apply sentiment analysis on a dataset that is given. Our datasets are tweets about archeage, hobbit and iphone6. As feature extractor cnn model and word2vec model (enchanced wÄ±th googlenews); As classifier evaluation class; to seperate the dataset into multiple files,Dataseperator is used.This program is written java using dl4j.
    Second implementationis  text analysis using machine learning models to classify movie review sentiments as positive or negative.This program is written python using pandas, sklearn(SupportVectorMachine,NaiveBayes,LogisticRegression,KNearestNeighbors).

  github: ryuz4k1/document-clustering
  description: |
    My main goal in this project was to aggregate the data sets, which were completely in the large document level, to their degree of closeness. There were two clustering algorithms that I researched. These are k-means clustering algorithm and mean-shift clustering algorithm. I used K-means clustering algorithm.

  description: |
    Data is the most important criterion for educating an algorithm. Because it learns the algorithm according to the data we will use and meets the requests. However, the more regularly we give our algorithm, the more efficient it will work. In this project, I am preparing the data for tensorflow. Briefly, video data is taken, divided into frames, augmentation is performed, renamed regularly, divided into two as test(%20) - train(%80).
